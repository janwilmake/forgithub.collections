# Collections for GitHub

prompt:

```md
https://cache.forgithub.com/openapi.json https://patch.forgithub.com

consider this /stars/{owner} endpoint. please, make me a cloudflare js worker that returns a html that renders an overview repos in a list from any owner on page /{owner}/{list-id} . on /{owner} it would just list the lists and allow clicking them to go to the overviews.
use simple html with cdn.tailwindcss.com script and import that as a html file in the worker. on the homepage, it should show 'Collections for GitHub' in the style of 'patch for github' website. ensure everything is in that style. ensure every page is in a separate html file , imported in the worker
```
